## 📌 Overview

The **Ticket SLA Analysis Dashboard** is a multi-sheet Excel workbook that takes a raw support-ticket export and turns it into a clean, department-tagged dataset with automated **SLA breach detection**, a **PivotTable summary**, and a **KPI dashboard**. It demonstrates practical spreadsheet skills used in real support/operations reporting: lookup-based enrichment, conditional flags, and roll-up metrics.

This project is designed to:
- Practice cleaning raw exported data (duplicate rows, row counts before/after)
- Apply `XLOOKUP` to enrich ticket data with department information
- Flag SLA breaches using conditional logic (`IF`)
- Summarize breach rates by channel and department with `COUNTIFS` / `PivotTable`
- Present headline KPIs on a single dashboard sheet

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

> **Objective:** Build a spreadsheet workflow that ingests raw ticket data and produces a reliable SLA breach report.

You are given a raw export of support tickets containing ticket ID, month, team, channel, resolution hours, and satisfaction score. Some rows are duplicated. The workbook must clean the data, attach each ticket's department via a lookup table, flag any ticket that breached the 24-hour SLA, and roll all of this up into a summary and dashboard view.

| 📂 Sheet | 📄 Type | 🔍 Description |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| Raw | Source Data | Original exported ticket rows (includes 1 duplicate) |
| Lookup | Reference Table | Maps `team_id` → team name & department |
| Clean | Processed Data | De-duplicated tickets enriched with department + breach flag |
| pivot_table | PivotTable | Average resolution hours by department × month |
| Summary | Aggregation | Breach count & breach rate by channel |
| Dashboard | KPI View | Total tickets, SLA breaches, breach rate, avg satisfaction |

---

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🧹 **Duplicate Handling** | Before/after row counts confirm de-duplication |
| 🔎 **XLOOKUP Enrichment** | Pulls department from a separate `Lookup` sheet by `team_id` |
| 🚩 **SLA Breach Flag** | `IF(resolution_hours > 24, 1, 0)` marks breaches automatically |
| 📊 **PivotTable Rollup** | Avg. resolution hours by department, broken out by month |
| 📈 **Channel Summary** | `COUNTIFS` totals breached tickets per channel (Email/Chat/Phone) |
| 🖥️ **KPI Dashboard** | One-glance cards: total tickets, breaches, breach rate, avg satisfaction |
| 🔗 **Fully Formula-Driven** | No manual values in derived sheets — everything recalculates live |

## 🧹 Part A — Data Cleaning

### 📝 1. De-duplication

> The `Raw` sheet contains 13 rows, one of which is an exact duplicate. The `Clean` sheet removes it and both row counts are tracked with formulas for auditability.

**Logic:**
```
After Row Count  = COUNTA(A2:A13)
Before Row Count = COUNTA(Raw!A2:A14)
```

---

### 🔎 2. Department Enrichment (XLOOKUP)

> Each ticket's `team_id` is matched against the `Lookup` sheet to pull in its department.

**Logic:**
```
=XLOOKUP(C2, Lookup!$A$2:$A$5, Lookup!$C$2:$C$5)
```

---

### 🚩 3. SLA Breach Flag

> Any ticket resolved in more than 24 hours is flagged as a breach.

**Logic:**
```
=IF(E2>24, 1, 0)
```

---

## 📊 Part B — Dashboard & Reporting

### 🔍 4. Channel Summary

> Counts breached tickets per channel and computes an overall breach rate.

**Logic:**
```
Breached Tickets = COUNTIFS(Clean!$D$2:$D$13, A2, Clean!$H$2:$H$13, 1)
SLA Breach Rate  = COUNTIF(Clean!H2:H13, 1) / COUNTA(Clean!A2:A13)
```

---

### 📌 5. PivotTable — Department × Month

> Shows average resolution hours for each department, broken down by month, with grand totals.

| Row Labels | Jan | Feb | Mar | Grand Total |
|------------|-----|-----|-----|-------------|
| Service    | 20  | 19  | 19  | 19.33 |
| Technical  | 28  | 29  | 28  | 28.33 |
| **Grand Total** | 24 | 24 | 23.5 | 23.83 |

---

### 🖥️ 6. Dashboard KPIs

**Key Concepts Used:**

| Concept | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| 🔁 `COUNTA` | Total ticket count |
| 🔎 `COUNTIF` | SLA breach count |
| ➗ Division | Breach rate as a ratio |
| ➕ `AVERAGE` | Average satisfaction score |

**Sample KPI Row:**
```
Total Tickets: 12   |  SLA Breaches: 5  |  Breach Rate: 0.42  |  Avg Satisfaction: 3.58
```
