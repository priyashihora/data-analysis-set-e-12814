## 📌 Overview

The **Support Ticket Analysis** notebook is a `pandas`-driven Jupyter workflow that loads a raw ticket CSV export, cleans it, and analyzes SLA (Service Level Agreement) breaches by **department** and **team**. It demonstrates core data-analysis skills: type coercion, de-duplication, merging reference data, group-by aggregation, and deriving KPI-style summary tables.

This project is designed to:
- Strengthen understanding of `pandas` DataFrame operations
- Practice type validation and de-duplication on real-world messy data
- Merge fact and lookup tables to enrich ticket records
- Aggregate breach rates by department and team using `groupby`

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

> **Objective:** Build a notebook-based analysis pipeline to clean support-ticket data and surface SLA breach patterns.

You are given a CSV export of support tickets (`ticket.csv`) with ticket ID, month, team, channel, resolution hours, and satisfaction score. The notebook must validate data types, remove duplicate rows, merge in department information, and compute breach rates — both overall by department, and per team to identify the worst-performing team.

| 📂 Step | 📄 Type | 🔍 Description |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Load CSV | Data Ingestion | Reads raw ticket export into a DataFrame |
| Type Check | Validation | Confirms `resolution_hours` / `satisfaction` are numeric |
| De-duplicate | Cleaning | Drops exact duplicate rows |
| Merge | Enrichment | Joins ticket data with a team/department lookup |
| Group & Aggregate | Analysis | Computes breach counts and rates by department/team |

The goal is to demonstrate **practical pandas data-cleaning and aggregation skills** through a realistic support-ops dataset.

---

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 📥 **CSV Ingestion** | Loads ticket data directly with `pd.read_csv` |
| ✅ **Type Coercion** | `pd.to_numeric(..., errors="raise")` enforces strict numeric columns |
| 🧹 **De-duplication** | `drop_duplicates()` with an `assert` check on the resulting row count |
| 🔗 **Merge-Based Enrichment** | Ticket data merged with department lookup for grouped analysis |
| 🔢 **Department Summary** | Total tickets, breached count, and SLA breach rate per department |
| 🏆 **Team-Level Ranking** | Identifies the team with the single highest breach rate |
| 📊 **Matplotlib Import** | Ready for chart-based visualization of results |

## 🧹 Part A — Data Preparation

### 📝 1. Loading & Type Validation

> Raw CSV columns are coerced to numeric types so downstream aggregation is safe.

**Logic:**
```python
tickets = pd.read_csv("ticket.csv")

tickets["resolution_hours"] = pd.to_numeric(
    tickets["resolution_hours"], errors="raise"
)
tickets["satisfaction"] = pd.to_numeric(
    tickets["satisfaction"], errors="raise"
)
```

---

### 🧹 2. De-duplication

> Exact duplicate rows are dropped, with an assertion confirming the expected clean row count.

**Logic:**
```python
print("Before removing duplicates:", len(tickets))
tickets = tickets.drop_duplicates().copy()
print("After removing duplicates:", len(tickets))
assert len(tickets) == 12
```

**Output:**
```
Before removing duplicates: 13
After removing duplicates: 12
```

---

## 🔢 Part B — Breach Analysis

### 🏢 3. Department-Wise Summary

> Groups the merged, enriched dataset by department to compute total tickets, breached tickets, and breach rate.

**Logic:**
```python
department_summary = (
    merged.groupby("department")
    .agg(
        total_tickets=("ticket_id", "count"),
        breached_count=("breach_flag", "sum")
    )
    .reset_index()
)

department_summary["sla_breach_rate"] = (
    department_summary["breached_count"]
    / department_summary["total_tickets"] * 100
).round(2)
```

---

### 🏆 4. Team With Highest Breach Rate

> Groups by team to find which single team has the worst SLA breach rate.

**Logic:**
```python
team_summary = (
    merged.groupby("team_id")
    .agg(
        total_tickets=("ticket_id", "count"),
        breached_count=("breach_flag", "sum")
    )
    .reset_index()
)

team_summary["breach_rate"] = (
    team_summary["breached_count"]
    / team_summary["total_tickets"] * 100
).round(2)

highest_team = team_summary.loc[team_summary["breach_rate"].idxmax()]
```

**Key Concepts Used:**

| Concept | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| 🔗 `merge` | Joins ticket facts with team/department lookup |
| 🧮 `groupby().agg()` | Named aggregation for count & sum |
| ➗ Breach Rate | `breached_count / total_tickets * 100` |
| 🏆 `idxmax()` | Locates the row with the highest breach rate |
